echo "Multiplication: " && echo "$num1 * $num2" | bc
echo "Division: " && echo "scale=2; $num1 / $num2" | bc

if (( $num1 > $num2 ))
then 
	echo "Max: $num1"
	echo "Min: $num2"
else
	echo "Max: $num2"
	echo "Min: $num1"
fi

done  
echo "Until Loop Series"
a=1
until [ ! $a -le $num ]
do
   echo $a
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done
b=1
echo "While Loop Series"
while [ $b -le $num ]
do
   echo $b
   b=`expr $b + 1`

echo "-----Last 10 lines-----"
tail -n 10 $file

(ii). Display line no. 3 to 8 from file contains.
#! /bin/bash 
echo "Enter file"
read file
head -n 8 $file | tail -6

(iii). Display 7 lines and start from second last line in reverse manner.
#! /bin/bash 
echo "Enter file"
read file
tail -n 9 $file | head -7 | tac
9. Perform following task:

 (i). Add two new users and two groups

#! /bin/bash 
echo "Enter user1 name: "
read user1
echo "Enter user2 name: "
read user2

echo "Enter group1 name: "
read group1
echo "Enter group2 name: "
read group2

useradd $user1
useradd $user2
groupadd $group1
groupadd $group2
(ii). Login as one user and then create new file

#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter username: "
read username

su $username

echo "Enter filename: "
read filename
touch $filename

(iii). Send created file from one user to another user

#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter file location on user1: "
read source
echo "Enter Destination Location on user2: "
read destination
